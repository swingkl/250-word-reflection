I had imagined that the care which I assumed of the schools and the masters
would amount only to a marginal involvement committing me to no more than
providing for the subsistence of the masters and assuring that they acquitted 
themselves of their tasks with piety and devotedness ... Indeed, if I had ever 
thought that the care I was taking of the schoolmasters out of pure charity 
would ever have made it my duty to live with them, I would have dropped the 
whole project. ... God, who guides all things with wisdom and serenity, whose 
way it is not to force the inclinations of persons, willed to commit me entirely to 
the development of the schools. He did this in an imperceptible way and over a 
long period of time so that one commitment led to another in a way that I did 
not foresee in the beginning.
